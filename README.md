- User Experience (UX): Prioritize intuitive navigation, clear information hierarchy, and seamless interactions.
- Performance: Optimize page load times, minimize server requests, and optimize image sizes for efficient performance.
- Content Readability: Chose appropriate typography, font sizes, and line spacing to enhance readability.
- Visual Hierarchy: Used visual cues, typography, and color to guide users' attention and prioritize important content.
